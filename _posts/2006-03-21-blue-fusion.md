So [Blue Fusion](http://www.ibm.com/uk/bluefusion) has finished for the year. IT was incredible fun, and got in at least one [paper](http://www.thisissouthampton.co.uk/hampshire/southampton/news/SOTON_NEWS_NEWS6.html) (the Hampshire Chronicle did send a reporter, but no photographer so I took photos of the event for them as the official photographer for the event) but I have not yet found their article online.

I still need to sort through the photos and put a few online so you can see them. There are also posts on [some](http://eightbar.co.uk/2006/03/16/fame-and-bananas/) [blogs](http://eightbar.co.uk/2006/03/15/the-genetics-of-dragons-and-the-wisdom-of-monkeys/) (I will be introducing this blog soon) and also a [post](http://thelostoutpost.blogspot.com/2006/03/genetics-of-dragons-wisdom-of-monkeys.html) here.

The week was great fun, but unfortunately I don&#8217;t have the time to really write about it, though the Blue Fusion website should eventually get some write-ups put on to it, though I am not sure when that will happen&#8230;
