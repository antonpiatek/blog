There is an interesting article on the DRM in the new IBM laptops with [finger scanners](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/10/05/biometric_thinkpad_t42/) on [InformationWeek](http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2006/02/yes_trusted_com.html). The article goes a little further than most though, showing that the DRM can be used to track what documents you open and when. This is scary stuff. The finger scanners are not that new either  
I am however waiting for that nice finger scanner to log me on to all my websites, as the security chip in the laptop authenticates the fingerprint and then sends something like a public key to the server. All that I need to do is set up the website to accept that log on&#8230; maybe someone will do it soon.
