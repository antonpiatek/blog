While posting the Fosters photos above, I decided to check the submissions queue (on the bizarre offchance that somebody other than me wrote something for this site). Of course there was nothing there, but I did notice a link to moderating commetns. In there I found 2 comments by Shogun. Unfortunately because the internet is full of people with dishonerable intentions, anonymous comments need to be moderated&#8230; (Otherwise I get spam comments with nothing but links to viagra and online gambline sites. [Both together? :s ] )

**Shogun**: If you create an account (I know, creating accounts is painful) then comments \*should\* get posted straight away and be visible.

The other way is to just enable anonymous comments, and then for me to try and delete the spam&#8230; With other sites the amount of spam wasn&#8217;t very much, so maybe I should persue that option. In any case, I think I might need to play with the comments options and see what works best.
