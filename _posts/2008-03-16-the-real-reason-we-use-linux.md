[An Amazing Mind](http://blog.anamazingmind.com/2008/03/real-reason-we-use-linux.html) has an interesting insight into why people use linux

>   _We tell people we use Linux because it&#8217;s secure. Or because it&#8217;s free, because it&#8217;s customizable, because it&#8217;s free (the other meaning), because it has excellent community support&#8230;  
>  
> But all of that is just marketing bullshit. We tell that to non-Linuxers because they wouldn&#8217;t understand the real reason. And when we say those false reasons enough, we might even start to believe them ourselves.  
>  
> But deep underneath, the real reason remains.  
>  
> We use Linux **because it&#8217;s fun**!  
>  
> It&#8217;s fun to tinker with your system. It&#8217;s fun to change all the settings, break the system, then have to go to recovery mode to repair it. It&#8217;s fun to have over a hundred distros to choose from. It&#8217;s fun to use the command line.

> Let me say that again. **It&#8217;s fun to use the command line.**  
>  
> No wonder non-Linuxers wouldn&#8217;t understand.
