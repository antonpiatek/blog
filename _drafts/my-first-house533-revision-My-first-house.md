It&#8217;s been a bit quiet here lately, and the main reason for that is I have just bought my first house.

The months of back-and-forth with solicitors is finally over and I have the keys &#8211; YAY!

It didn&#8217;t help that the solicitors got the postal address wrong, using my current street with the postcode of the house I was trying to buy. Then the person handling the case moved departments and that left a few weeks of chasing a dead-end. Finally it is all done though, and it really wasn&#8217;t as bad as I thought it was going to be.

The fride/freezer, washing machine, dishwasher and cooker are all arriving this week (which will be kind of exciting) and after we have actually finished packing and moved all the stuff we already own that will just leave a sofa to buy (though they don&#8217;t come cheap).

So hopefully I will have some more time to write posts soon, and as I already have internet at the new house I guess I have no more excuses (other than finishing packing, moving, and unpacking that is)
