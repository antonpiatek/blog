[All about Linux: The unabridged selective transcript of Richard M Stallman&#8217;s talk at the ANU](http://linuxhelp.blogspot.com/2006/04/unabridged-selective-transcript-of.html) is a copy of RMS&#8217;s views on the naming of GNU/Linux, the DMCA, DRM, Java, Opensource and is quite an interesting read if you are interested in free software / linux / your right to create software.[
