The photo right out of the camera looks incredibly red.

I use Bibble to convert my raw files &#8211; during the conversion I set the white balance to &#8220;click white&#8221;, and select somewhere on the grass or a leaf. The idea is to remove the red tint from the light leaves in the image, but the sky can still have a dark red tint (in fact the red tint is usually desired). I have also seen posts where people suggest setting a custom white balance in camera to a photo with the frame full of grass, however I have not tried this

Auto levels or curves can be used as well during raw conversion to increase the contrast in the image, I also often apply noise reduction and sharpening, then I rotate and crop if required before exporting to The Gimp.

In The Gimp the first thing I do is Colours -> Components -> Channel Mixer, where I set the red channel to output 100% blue, and the blue channel to output 100% red (the other colours in each channel are set to 0%).

This may or may not be desired, depending on whether it looks better with a blue sky or red. I often cannot decide so do both.

Then, if desired, you can export to greyscale. Try Colours -> Desaturate or Colours -> Components -> Decompose.

If you get odd highlights

These can be corrected by adjusting the saturation of cyan to -100, maybe increasing the lightness slightly too. Colours -> Hue-Saturation will get you there.

And there you have it &#8211; all you need to get started in IR post processing.

I got my ideas for workflow from the following sites:
