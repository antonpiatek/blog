[IBM wins most U.S. patents in 2008](http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSTRE50D3G020090114?feedType=RSS&feedName=technologyNews)

> Reuters &#8211; International Business Machines Corp said on Wednesday it became the first company ever to win more than 4,000 U.S. patents in a single year, citing a new report from research firm IFI Patent Intelligence.

Not entirely surprising&#8230; there is huge drive in the labs to submit patents

I suspect IBM has had this title for quite a few years.
