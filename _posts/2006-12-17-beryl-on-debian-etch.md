I spent today playing with [Beryl](http://www.beryl-project.org) and getting it running on Debian Etch. Beryl is a fork from Compiz and similar to XGL, and if you do not know what is is, have a look on [google video](http://video.google.co.uk/videosearch?q=beryl) or [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryl_(window_manager)). It is visually stunning, and while not completely stable I have not had any problems with it so long as I kept the blur and focustrail plugins turned off.

Setting it up was actually very easy. The Beryl wiki has a nice [Debian install page](http://wiki.beryl-project.org/wiki/Install/Debian), but to sum it up I had to add a new apt sources entry, install a few packages, edit my xorg config file, restart X and then just run it!

This is the kind of thing that will make every windows user say &#8220;What are you running? Where can I get that?&#8221;

If you are running linux I would definitely suggest you install it and give it a go. It runs as a window manager, and can be simply run manually so that you don&#8217;t have to have it on all the time (it is so new I would not call it stable, but it seems pretty reliable to me).

The transparency of a playing movie is incredible, not to mention all the other wonderful effects.
