According to The Register, [Students think mainframes are cool](http://theregister.co.uk/2006/06/09/students_love_mainframes/)

Bit of a shock, though I do wish I could have had the chance to play with them at uni&#8230; I am struggling to find time to learn much about them during work so it will probably be a slow road to actually using them.
