I have been playing with google wave for about a week, and while it is interesting I have not really had enough time with it to write up much here yet.

If you are on Wave, you can find me as &#8220;anton.piatek&#8221; on google wave

If you are not on Wave and want to have a play, I will give an invite to the first person that comments on this post asking for one (only one, so if there is already a comment asking then you are too late). Please fill in the email field in the comment box (which stays private) as I will send the invite there
