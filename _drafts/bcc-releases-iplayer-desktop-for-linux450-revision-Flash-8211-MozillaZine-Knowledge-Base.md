First I had trouble upgrading flash &#8211; Installing it was easy, but I found I still had a flash 9 install listed in my about:plugins page. Following the [Flash &#8211; MozillaZine Knowledge Base](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Macromedia_Flash#Linux_and_Solaris) page helped me solved this (it turns out I had a flash 9 file in my ~/.mozilla/plugins folder)

Then it was time to install iplayer. First it installed Adobe AIR, which was simple enough. Then the iplayer desktop app installed inside AIR &#8211; the security dialog for this was particularly unappealing as it did not have any knowledge of the publisher, let alone a secure signature or certificate to assure me it was really BCC content I was installing
