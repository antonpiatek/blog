I have been thinking about home automation, in particular lighting and appliance automation and so thought I would post some of the stuff I found (both for you and so I don&#8217;t forget it all) There is a nice article on the basics of [controlling X10 with debian](http://www.aboutdebian.com/x10.htm), though some of the parts seem to no longer exist. Buying X10 equipment looks harder in the UK than the US (and it makes a difference as automation that runs through your power cables must work on the correct voltage!). [Habitek](http://www.habitek.co.uk/catalog/cat23_1.htm), [letsautomate](http://www.letsautomate.com/index.cfm?&Nav=X10&) and [simplyautomate](http://www.simplyautomate.co.uk/search.asp?catid=82&Cat1=82) all seem to sell 240V models, but let&#8217;s go over what you can do with it all&#8230; With a [serial](http://www.simplyautomate.co.uk/productdisplay.asp?id=3722) or [usb](http://www.simplyautomate.co.uk/productDisplay.asp?prodid=5690) interface you can do some computer control, though I have a problem in that I have no serial ports left and the supplier has no linux drivers (and didn&#8217;y give me the manufacturer so I can&#8217;t ask them). I could make a gamble that I can figure out a usb driver, or look for a serial->usb adapter and hope that allows me to use serial style commands to control it (anyone know? what about under linux?) or look for an expansion card with serial ports. Anyway, once you have a controller you can control thins that are plugged into the appliance modules. You can control lights (with dimmer control!) and appliances. You need another adapter though for each appliance (some light ones have a nice screw bulb adaptor so you can plug it into a cieling light, and if you feel adventurous even refit that to a bayonette fitting so you can use it in any light!). Each adapter is like a plug in timer for your appliance. It is a simple pass-thrpough adapter which has a code to let you address it individually. Of course there is always a [radio remote control adapter](http://www.simplyautomate.co.uk/productdisplay.asp?id=3528) so you can use a radio remote to control stuff and not just your computer. There is some really good info [here](http://www.geocities.com/ido_bartana/) including the theory of how it all works, which is quite clever as the control signals are acutally sent along your power cables.
