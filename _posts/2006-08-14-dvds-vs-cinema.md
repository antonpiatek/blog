I have bought several DVD&#8217;s recently. [Spiderman](http://imdb.com/title/tt0145487/) & [Spiderman 2](http://imdb.com/title/tt0316654/) (for £6/7 for both from play.com), [Batman Begins](http://imdb.com/title/tt0372784/) and [Serenity](http://imdb.com/title/tt0379786/) (both for £5 each from asda). I don&#8217;t mind missing them in the cinema too much. I get annoyed with cinema&#8217;s that don&#8217;t (can&#8217;t?) focus films properly, and having been a projectionist myself I cannot understand why (it is not that hard!). Why should I spend the same amount of money (or more to take my girlfriend) on going to see a blurry film, when I can buy the DVD for the same price a short while later? Not to mention that if I want any popcorn/snacks in the cinema, I either have to smuggle it in or get robbed by the prices the cinema&#8217;s charge.

I cannot help but feel that it would be a better investment to buy a pc projector and just get all my films on dvd. Then I can watch them again with friends whenever I want!
