There is an article over on IGN about the Nintendo [Revolution&#8217;s Horsepower](http://revolution.ign.com/articles/699/699118p1.html). As you cannot buy a next-gen console without buying an IBM chip, it is interesting to see how Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft are playing their cards. Nintendo is the only one not going for sheer processing power, so maybe they will put the effort into getting some great games made for the console. The cheaper price will certainly tempt me to buy one over the other two.[
