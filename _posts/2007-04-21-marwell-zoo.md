  I spent the best part of today at Marwell Zoo. Photos are available in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/antonpiatek/tags/marwell/">flickr</a> or in <a href="http://www.strangeparty.com/wordpress/v/2007/Marwell+Zoo/">my gallery</a>

  I have not normally been particularly pleased with the photos from my 75-300 lens as it is a fairly cheap one, however today it was excellent (although slow to focus at times).Â  The only problems were reflections from glass or wires from the fences of the enclosures.
