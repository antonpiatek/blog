Flickr now has stas! If you are a Pro flickr user then you can turn on stats from the &#8220;you&#8221; menu on your main page.

See the [blog post](http://blog.flickr.com/2007/12/13/stats-stats-baby/) or the [FAQ](http://www.flickr.com/help/stats/) for more info  [](http://blog.flickr.com/2007/12/13/stats-stats-baby/)

&#8220;We’ve designed stats on Flickr to give you all sorts of insight into how people arrive at your photos. If you’re a pro member you can activate your stats now.&#8221;
