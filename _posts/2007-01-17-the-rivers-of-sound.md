On Sunday night I was invited to take photos for a friends band &#8211; [The Rivers of Sound](http://www.myspace.com/theriversofsound), who were playing in the [Wedgewood rooms](http://www.wedgewood-rooms.co.uk/).[

It was quite a lot of fun, as I have never taken photos for a band at a proper gig venue, and the backstage access etc was quite cool. Anyway, they are a really good indie rock band, they have some songs on MySpace (link above) and if you live in Hampshire they are worth coming to their next gig in February for. Here are a couple of photos from Sunday night.
