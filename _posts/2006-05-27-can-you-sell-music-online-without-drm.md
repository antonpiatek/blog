This article on [eMusic](http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/emusic.ars/1) is quite an interesting read&#8230; If you have ever wondered if many companies sell music online that you can play on all your mp3 players (no DRM/windows media/AAC rubbish) then check out the article.

It has some glaring ommisions of course, most notably [audiolunchbox](http://audiolunchbox.com/) who have the [first 3 offspring albums](http://audiolunchbox.com/find.php?t=&fi=offspring) among other mainstream music. Audolunchbox also sell only high quality unrestricted mp3&#8217;s so you can do what you want with your music. The big difference is that eMusic is a subscription model whereas audioluncbox is a purchase per track/album model. As it is all mp3 without DRM you can keep it all no matter what, but I am not sure if you are allowed to keep eMusic&#8217;s songs after you cancel the subscription &#8211; you&#8217;d have to check the details on their site (not that they can stop you anyway)
