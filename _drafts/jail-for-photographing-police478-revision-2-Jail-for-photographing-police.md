I can&#8217;t believe what I am reading! &#8211; This is rediculous!

I understand that taking photos of sensetive buildings could be considered a security risk, and that places like airports already have restricted rights for taking photos, but the police and public places?

This is a serious problem for professional, particularly press, photographers but also amateur photographers. It won&#8217;t be long before you have to get any public photos approved by the government, and then we really will have an Orwellian Big Brother watching over us
