I've been meaning to move away from wordpress for years. I don't use anything fancy on it, and a static site is both safer to host as can't really get hacked and doesn't need patching, as well as being potentially easier to host.

To this end, I've moved to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as it has an easy export from wordpress and can be hosted by github pages quite easily and therefore hosted very easily (including custom domains).

Comments in this case are via [Gisgus](https://giscus.app/), thanks to [@calanais](https://twitter.com/calanais) for suggesting this option.

The move would have been a lot easier had I not tried to several years ago and then ignored it, as it turns out that having old files from old themes checked in is quite a pain and overwrites all your new themes, and causes hours of debugging...

I'm sure there's loads more to fix up on this, but for now I've got what I wanted - something I can easily add posts to, not have to worry about security, and migrates my old posts. Old comments are lost, but probably not really of much interest.

One other thing I wanted to acheieve in the move was preserving all old blog urls, and you can setup the posts to reflect the same wordpress url layout, so I'm hoping I can simply write an apache redirect url pattern to forward to me new blog domain
