So darkknight.co.uk needs a revamp. Im in the process of deleting all photos from it, and adding them all again (This time with proper watermarking that is terrbile)

Not sure when I will have time for that though&#8230;

I am also still playing with gallery2 on our home server, and as soon as i can get an import of some sort working ill probably move over to it. 

Maybe I will move over sooner, and just start adding albums by hand slowly&#8230; It would certainly be much nicer than the current gallery.
