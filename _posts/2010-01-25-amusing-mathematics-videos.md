So while I am sat on the sofa, my wife is watching mathematics videos fromÂ <http://mrbartonmaths.com/youtube.htm>. There are some rather amusing and clever videos so have a look when you get a chance.

Particularly clever are [The Mathematics Love Song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vba9eV8RS6M&feature=player_embedded) which attempts to explain love using group theory (which I vaguely remember from my degree)

[Amazing Maths trick that proves 1=2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkSow7FtWmA&feature=player_embedded) is one I have seen many times before  
(in case you wondered, the proof fails because it is invalid to divide by 0 [strictly speaking you get an undefined result], so the proof must have an initial restriciton of _a != b_ at the beginning to be valid (and therefore does not prove 1=2))

[James Blunt also sings his Triangle song for Sesame Street](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2Z6tDSb6c8&feature=player_embedded), which is rather odd to listen to.

[Mathematical Pie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJJJmQojcLM&feature=player_embedded) is rather interesting too (yes, it is a mathematical cover of American Pie)

Of course you shouldn&#8217;t miss the [Abbott and Costello maths](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyUncKI7oU&feature=player_embedded) which is phoenomenal
