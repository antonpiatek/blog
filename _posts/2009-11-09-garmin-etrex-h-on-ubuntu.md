Last month my wife got me a [Garmin Etrex-H](http://www.garmin.com/products/etrexH/) walking GPS for my birthday. On friday my [usb data cable from Kawa Mall](http://www.kawamall.com/cat_for_etrex.cfm) (bought via ebay) arrived.

Getting data from the gps was trivial with [gpsbabel](http://www.gpsbabel.org) (thought you might find it easier to use the [gebabbel gui frontend](http://gebabbel.sourceforge.net/) and getting a track uploaded to a Google Map was easy via [gpsvisualizer](http://www.gpsvisualizer.com). I have not yet managed to upload a route with waypoints to the gps device yet though.

I am also unsure which software will be easiest to plot a route in. [Marengo](http://www.marengo-ltd.com/map/) looks like a possible choice, as a web route planner, or possibly I can do it with Google Earth, or [QLandKarte](http://qlandkarte.sourceforge.net/) (though I would need to find or generate a calibrated map for this) which can read and write the gps device directly (again using gpsbabel)

Has anyone got recommendations for gps track editing software as well as route planning software?

[Bluemonki has some geotagging voodoo](http://blog.bluemonki.net/2008/07/16/how-to-automaticallyautomagically-geotag-your-photos-using-open-source-stuffs/) that I need to look at so I can start recording where my photos were taken which should be interesting
