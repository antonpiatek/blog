I had never thought of combining time-lapse photography (making a video by taking lots of photos and turning them into a sped up video, similar to stop-motion) with a tilt-shift lens (a very expensive and custom lens normally used to correct odd perspective problems but also has the effect of a narrow depth of field if you want it that makes the scene look like it is a macro photo when it is really a very wide angle shot)

The video below is just incredible!
