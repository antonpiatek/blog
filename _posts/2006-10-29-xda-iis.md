i have just got a XDA IIIs from a friend, and am in fact writing this post on it via my home wifi.  
I used to have an original XDA, but it had a lot wrong with it. This one has fixed most of my gripes. For a start the phone is properly integrated, and of course wifi is an excellent addition.  
I still have not got MMS working and have some issues with GPRS, but i love the thing. The only software issue i can find is that the internet browser cannot do landscape viewing, but Opera might solve that for me&#8230;  
This site even looks reasonable on it, which was quite a pleasant surprise.
