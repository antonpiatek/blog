Did you know that Southampton has a makerspace/hackerspace?

What is a hackerspace/makerspace? __

> _A hackerspace (also referred to as a hacklab, makerspace, or hackspace) is a community-operated workspace where people with common interests, often in computers, technology, science, digital art or electronic art, can meet, socialise and/or collaborate. [[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace)]_

SoMakeIt is Southampton&#8217;s makerspace has existed for 3 months. It is [open Tuesdays 7:30 &#8211; 10:00pm, Saturdays 2:00 &#8211; 8:00pm](http://www.somakeit.org.uk/contact/) and is [located in Holybrook rd](http://www.somakeit.org.uk/contact/). We have a [website](http://www.somakeit.org.uk/) and [wiki](https://wiki.somakeit.org.uk/wiki/Main_Page) and are home to the longer-running group [Southackton](http://southackton.org.uk/).

We are run by our members, for our members, and are entirely funded by member donations. I should probably point out that [I am also a trustee of SoMakeIt.](http://www.somakeit.org.uk/trustees/)
