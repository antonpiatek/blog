I noticed that [Yahoo recently started offering OpenID authentication](http://openid.yahoo.com/) as part of a Yahoo account, this means you can now use your Yahoo Id or Flickr account to authenticate for comments on this blog. Of course I had to install the [wordpress openid plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/openid) to make that work.

If you don&#8217;t know much about OpenId&#8217;s, you may want to read more about them on [OpenID.net](http://openid.net). A quick summary is that an OpenID allows you to log in to sites that support OpenID but having one username and password on a OpenID server. You just put the address of your OpenID (which can be your own website) and the other website asks your OpenID server whether you have logged in.[  
](http://openid.net) 

If you don&#8217;t want to use Yahoo&#8217;s OpenID, you can use any [OpenID provider](http://openid.net/get/) (which is the point of OpenID) such as Blogger,Wordpress or even build your own OpenID provider just for you.

I decided to build my own, mostly for curiousity. I used [phpMyId](http://siege.org/projects/phpMyID/), which is about the simplest php script to install. Drop the 2 files in the right place, edit the files to create the username/password (you may need access to a command line linux box for this) and then you can log in. If you want to make your website be the address for an OpenID, you need to [add some html to the header of the index page (called delegating your OpenID](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2007/01/03/OpenID-for-non-SuperUsers)) but this is included in the instructions for phpMyId.

Once you have an OpenId, you will probably want [to test it](http://openidenabled.com/resources/openid-test/).
