A koala is sitting in a tree smoking a joint when a little lizard walks past and looks up and says to the koala &#8220;Hey! What are you doing?&#8221;

The koala says &#8220;Smoking a joint, come up and have some.&#8221;

So the little lizard climbs up and sits next to the koala and they have a few joints. After a while the little lizard says his mouth is dry and is going to get a drink from the river.

The little lizard is so stoned that he leans too far over and falls into the river. A crocodile sees this and swims over to the little lizard and helps him to the side, then asks the little lizard, &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221;

The little lizard explains to the crocodile that he was sitting smoking a joint with the koala in the tree, got too stoned and then fell into the river while taking a drink. The crocodile says he has to check this out and walks into the forest, finds the tree where the koala is sitting finishing a joint, and he looks up and says &#8220;Hey you!&#8221;

The koala looks down and says

&#8220;Faaaaarrrrk dude&#8230;&#8230;.how much water did you drink?!!&#8221;
