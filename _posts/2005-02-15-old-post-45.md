Divers beware!

The BBC says that the gnomes at the bottom of a lake in the Lake District may be [returning](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cumbria/4263761.stm)

The police removed them because of deaths in the lake, but apparently people are putting them back.

I know divers who report having seen them around 45m deep. 

Anyone want to go find them?
