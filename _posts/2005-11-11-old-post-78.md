[School drugs mix-up angers mother](http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/england/lincolnshire/4428372.stm) &#8211; _Police apologise after a bag of speed is inadvertently left in a schoolgirl&#8217;s bag during an anti-drugs day._ [[BBC News](http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/default.stm)]

&nbsp;This has to be the most amusing thing today&#8230;  
How do police get away with doing a drug demonstration and end up supplying? Surely they should be charged with supplying drugs? Or is it only supplying if you are charging for it?

Perhaps this is a loophole for dealers. I wouldn&#8217;t want to put it to the test though.
