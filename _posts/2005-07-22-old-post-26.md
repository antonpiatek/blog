This equation should be taught in all math classes!

From a strictly mathematical viewpoint it goes like this:

What Makes 100%? What does it mean to give MORE than 100%? Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more than 100%? We have all been to those meetings where someone wants you to  
give over 100%. How about achieving 103%? What makes up 100% in life?

Here&#8217;s a little mathematical formula that might help you answer these questions:

If:  
A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Y&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Z  
is represented as:  
1&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;10&nbsp;11&nbsp;12&nbsp;13&nbsp;14&nbsp;15&nbsp;16&nbsp;17&nbsp;18&nbsp;19&nbsp;20&nbsp;21&nbsp;22&nbsp;23&nbsp;24&nbsp;25&nbsp;26.

Then:

H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K  
8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98%

and  
K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E  
11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 = 96%

But,

A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E  
1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100%

And,

B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T  
2+21+12+12+19+8+9+20 = 103%

AND, look how far ass kissing will take you.

A-S-S-K-I-S-S-I-N-G  
1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7 = 118%

So, one can conclude with mathematical certainty that While Hard work and Knowledge will get you close, and Attitude will get you there, it&#8217;s the Bullshit and Ass kissing that will put you over the top.
