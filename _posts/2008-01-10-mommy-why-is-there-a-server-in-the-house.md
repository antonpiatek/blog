Gizmodo has an interesting set of pictures, apparently of a book from microsoft titled &#8220;Mommy, why is there a server in the house &#8211; Helping your child understand the stay-at-home server&#8221; They are a [hilarious read](http://gizmodo.com/photogallery/microserveces08/1000446145)

While I have a server at my house, and one at my parent&#8217;s house, and several friends that have their own &#8220;server&#8221;, I doubt that many families are looking at buying a serve. (When I say server, I mean a desktop that is on all the time, of course mine run linux).

The only problem with this idea is that it is rather environmentally unfriendly. Having a server on all the time is not good for the environment, however in my case I am using my two servers for 100G+ of data (mostly photos), so the cost of an online storage is too expensive.

For a lot of purposes, online storage is better and cheaper. Apple have .mac that achieves this.

The other big drawback is if you want data from outside your house, your upload ADSL speed is likely to be shocking!

It will be interesting to see how many people start using home servers, particularly Vista Home ones given the [file corruption problems](http://www.crn.com/software/205203806) reported for it
