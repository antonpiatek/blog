While in Northern Ireland for Christmas I slipped out to the coast to get a night shot. I really love the long exposure of the sea&#8230;

The photo would probably have been better taken a bit earlier while the sky still had a little bit of light. Maybe I will try it again sometime.

This is the right time of year for doing night and sunset shots as the sunset is early so you dont have to stay out too late to get them. Of course it is also colder&#8230;
