On new year&#8217;s eve we decided to go for a walk to try and shake off some of those calories from Christmas.

  
Trip recored in [EveryTrail](http://www.everytrail.com), [view full trip](http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=453763)

Following Walk #22 fromÂ [Hampshire and The New Forest Walks](http://www.crimsonpublishing.co.uk/book/details/9780711706095/jenny-plunknett-david-foster/hampshire-amp-the-new-forest-walks) (Pathfinder Guides) we had a nice time, though the recent wet weather meant the walk involved lots of avoiding puddles (some near lake proportions!). While I mention the book, I should say that it is a rather nice walking book as it not only has waypoint data that can be entered into a gps (though not really complete enough to just follow the gps), it also has excerpts of Ordnance Survey maps which are much better than the sketches some books use. The route description is also clear and easy to follow.
