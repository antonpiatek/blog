I gave in to the whole &#8220;smart phone&#8221; thing on the weekend and ordered a HTC Desire online. The phone arrived on Tuesday and has barely been out of my hand since.

The hardware is fairly similar to the iPhone in shape, but a matt-black back casing and sort of purplish-metallic looking trim. The screen may be slightly taller than the iPhone, but only just.

The touch-screen is a capacitive type and behaves wonderfully, though typing on the keyboard does take some getting used to.

One thing worth checking: I found (as did many other people if you search for it) that having the Twitter account enabled for updates (for example in Friend Stream) caused the calendar to continually poll for updates. This uses lots of battery (and probably bandwidth).

If you think something is using too much battery power, download the app &#8220;Spare Parts&#8221; from the Android market, and in it select &#8220;Battery History->Partial Wake Usage&#8221; and see what comes top. Mine used to show Calendar, but after removing the flickr account settings from the core OS &#8220;Settings->Accounts & Sync->Flickr->remove&#8221; and restarting the phone the bars are all very much smaller (and Calendar barely features on the usage)

Spare Parts looks incredibly useful, as you can also track bandwidth usage.

Hopefully my phone will last longer now
