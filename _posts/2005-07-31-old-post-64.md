So I should really be working. Yes, i know it is Sunday, but web contract work can be done anytime, and I have time now&#8230;

The distraction of the hour is <www.slashdot.org>, and I have certainly found some interesting reading:

  * Virigin have launched a [space flight company](http://www.virgingalactic.com/en/default.asp), and for $200,000 you can go to space in 2008. Space.com has an [article.](http://www.space.com/news/050727_branson_rutan.html)
  * [](http://www.space.com/news/050727_branson_rutan.html)A hacker has found some interesting [vulnerabilities on hotel TV system](http://www.wired.com/news/privacy/0,1848,68370,00.html). With a laptop with infrared (most have it) you can view other people&#8217;s bills, watch them check their email over their TV, or even write their email for them! Not to mention watch the premium content movies for free

Not bad reading actually&#8230; I wish I had $200k to go to space&#8230; Well, maybe i can find the $20,000 deposit now and then save up the other $180k by 2008?
