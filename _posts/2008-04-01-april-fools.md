I was looking for something good to post today, but the best I have found is [BBC NEWS |10 stories that could be April Fools&#8230; but aren&#8217;t](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7324127.stm)

I suppose [top-10-harmless-geek-pranks](http://lifehacker.com/373817/top-10-harmless-geek-pranks) isnt bad, and [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools'_Day) always has good gossip
