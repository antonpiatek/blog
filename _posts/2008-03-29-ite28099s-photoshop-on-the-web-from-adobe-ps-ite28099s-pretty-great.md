So Adobe has released their [web based photoshop](http://www.photoshop.com/express/landing.html). Its not a full photoshop (unsurprisingly) but it is free and available anywhere you have a browser.

I tried it out &#8211; First I was annoyed by the &#8220;US only&#8221; thing at registration, so I said I was in the US. then I was frustrated by how long the flash login box took to load up and then I found that I cannot import a single photo as it thinks they are all corrupted&#8230; I suspect it is because I am running Linux.

There is a brief review on [Photojojo](http://photojojo.com/content/websites/adobe-photoshop-express-web/) too, though they seemed to like it.

If you are looking for an online photo editor, its worth tryingÂ  [picnik](http://www.picnik.com/) too[
