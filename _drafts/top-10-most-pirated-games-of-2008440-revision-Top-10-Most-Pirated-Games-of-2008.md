Even with the terrible DRM shipped with Spore &#8211; 1.7 million pirated downloads in 3 months is one hell of a figure&#8230;

> As 2008 is slowly moving toward its end, we start taking a look at the most pirated titles in various categories. First up are games. As expected, Spore is by far the most downloaded game on BitTorrent, in part thanks to the DRM that came with the game.

I wonder when software publishers are going to try selling big title games without DRM to see how that compares?
