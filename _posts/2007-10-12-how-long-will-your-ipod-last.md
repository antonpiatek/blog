According to [The iPod Death Clock &#8211; iPodMechanic.com](http://www.ipodmechanic.com/deathclock/index.php), my brand new iPod has another 2 years left. Doubtful as my old one lasted about 5 years before the disk failed, and it would still run for around 8 hours before the battery failed. Given that I bought my new iPod with a 10% discount for recycling my old one, and a 6% IBM discount, so it only cost my Â£133 i think that is pretty good value for being able to take all my music with me and still have enough disk space on it to fit all my photos in raw format if I wanted to.

The new iPod Classic is also smaller than my old 3rd Gen iPod not to mention boasts some 40 hours of battery life when new too!
