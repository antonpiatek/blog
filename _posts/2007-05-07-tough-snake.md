On my way home from work on Friday I ran over a snake turning a corner on my motorbike. I heard the thing go crunch, and thought I had killed it. When I pulled up on to the pavement and had a look, the poor thing was still alive. Quite startled by a few passing cars it started slithering back off the road to the grass, but I went to get a look at it.

It was a pale green colour, getting lighter towards the belly, and had several rows of brown/black spots or diamons running down its length, close enough together to look almost like stripes. It was hardly more than 2cm diameter, but was almost a meter long. I am still having trouble identifying it though. According to wikipedia, [there are only 3 types of snake in the UK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_reptiles). Other sites seem to confirm this, but none say how many intriduced species there may be.

I doubt it was a [Grass Snake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_Snake), as the pattern is completely wrong and I did not notice any bands behind the head. There is no chance it was an adder as it is very different, so that really only leaves the [Smooth Snake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_Snake). The description of the pattern matches what I saw, but the colour of the snake is not correct. It is a shame I did not grab my phone and try to get a photo of it &#8211; I was half tempted to try and pick it up to get a closer look at the head (which might help identification) but even with leather motorbike gloves on was not so sure about that idea&#8230;
