[UserFriendly](http://www.userfriendly.org/) has 2 fabulous comic strips on Bank scams by phone (the kind where someone phones you up and pretends to be your bank in order to get secure information by asking you to &#8220;confirm&#8221; some details)  
[Cartoon 1](http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20080612), [Cartoon 2](http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20080613)

Its a shame that they don&#8217;t let you hotlink the images like [xkcd](http://xkcd.org/) does
