I was talking about unison a few posts ago (and a long time ago).

&nbsp;I finally got round to trying it under windows. I was a little hesitant at first, as it required installing a windows port of the linux OpenSSH program, which has to be run under Cygwin (which allows specially compiled linux programs to run under linux).

&nbsp;In the end, installing Cygwin was dead simple. And to get Unison to work, all i needed to do was edit the windows path (right click My Compter -> properties -> Advanced tab -> Environment variables -> PATH) and add the directory for Cygwin in it&#8230;

The unison help manual on their website gave clear instructions.

If anyone else has a linux box they can ssh into and wants to use it to synchronise files, it is dead simple!

If you have a windows box and want it to work across the internet, I am sure Cygwin has a windows port of an ssh server&#8230; so you could try that, though it could get complicated with file conversions (but it is probably worth a try).
