A major research institution has recently announced the discovery of the heaviest chemical element yet known to science. The new element has been tentatively named "IBMentium". IBMentium has 1 neutron, 12 assistant neutrons, 75 deputy neutrons, and 11 assistant deputy neutrons, giving it an atomic mass of 312. These 312 particles are held together by forces called morons, which are surrounded by vast quantities of lepton-like particles called peons. Since IBMentium has no electrons, it is inert. However, it can be detected as it impedes every reaction with which it comes into contact. A minute amount of IBMentium causes one reaction to take over 4 days to complete when it would normally take less than a second. 

IBMentium has a normal half-life of 3 years; it does not decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in which a portion of the assistant neutrons and deputy neutrons exchange places. In fact, IBMentium&#8217;s mass will actually increase over time, since each reorganization will cause some morons to become neutrons, forming isodopes. This characteristic of moron-promotion leads some scientists to speculate that IBMentium is formed whenever morons reach a certain quantity in concentration. This hypothetical quantity is referred to as "Critical Morass". You will know it when you see it.&nbsp;
