Following the previous post for migrating blogs, it turns out it is very easy in apache to simply redirect a whole website:

```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On

RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^strangeparty.com$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.strangeparty.com$
RewriteRule (.*)$ https://www.antonpiatek.dev/$1 [R=301,L]

</IfModule>

```
And now an old url, such as <https://www.strangeparty.com/2016/08/22/now-with-added-ssl-fromletsencrypt/> will simply work on the new host as the pages are in the same location
