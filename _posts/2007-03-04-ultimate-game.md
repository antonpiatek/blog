Yesterday morning the [Hursley Ultimate Club](http://www.huc.it) played a friendly against [Southampton Skunks](http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~dcf104/home.php). We both turned up with 2 teams, and played 2 games each.  
It was really good fun, and nice to play different people for a change. The hall at Southampton is much bigger than the one we have to play in, so it took a while to get used to the extra space. We drew two games, won one and lost one, so all in all a fairly even game.  
I am looking forward to playing a few more games and maybe entering a tournament at some point.
