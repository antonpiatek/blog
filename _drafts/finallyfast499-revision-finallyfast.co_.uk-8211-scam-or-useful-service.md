I recently saw an ad on tv for finallyfast.co.uk which offers a &#8220;pc speedup service&#8221;. The ad immediately made me think it was a scam because of the way it was done.

A quick google shows I am not alone:

  * [finallyfast.com | Web Safety Ratings from McAfee SiteAdvisor](http://www.siteadvisor.com/sites/finallyfast.com) &#8211; doesn&#8217;t rate it as bad but user comments seem to
  * [Mrkass’s Weblog | beware of pc speedscan

  * [Bill Mullins’ Weblog | Finally Fast.com &#8211; Fast Scam! Free Alternative Software](http://billmullins.wordpress.com/2008/10/27/finally-fastcom-fast-scam-free-alternative-software/)[

  * [PC Advisor| consumerwatch &#8211; Spyware remover advertised on the telly](http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/forums/index.cfm?action=showthread&threadid=345815&forumid=2) 

There is also a [youtube video of the (US version)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?hl=en-GB&v=In9jCKDcaf0&gl=GB) ad along with some user comments which give a feel for user feedback

I would recommend extreme caution when going to this site, and would certainly not recommend it to anyone
