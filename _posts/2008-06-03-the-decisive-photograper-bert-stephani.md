[Bert Stephani (](http://bertstephani.com/blog/?p=66)[Confessions of a Photographer)](http://bertstephani.com/blog/?p=66)[](http://bertstephani.com/blog/?p=66) has done two very interesting posts as part of a workshop he ran titled &#8220;The Decisive Photograper&#8221; &#8211; [Live Shoot Outdoor](http://bertstephani.com/blog/?p=66) and [Live Shoot Indoor](http://bertstephani.com/blog/?p=65) make for fantastic reading if you want to know more about balancing a portable flash with natural light for that perfect portrait.

I have bee following Bert&#8217;s blog for a while now, and it really is fantastic &#8211; I strongly recommend reading through his archive, particularly for the videos he&#8217;s done during shoots.
