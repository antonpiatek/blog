Two and a half weeks ago, I gave in and started reading Harry Potter. 

I have just finished the 6th book (the half blood prince), and really wish the final on was out. 

I won&#8217;t talk about the book because I do not want to spoil it for those who have not yet finished it, but it is really good. It does however make the final book seem like it must be really different from the others, you will see what I mean when you finish it.

If you haven&#8217;t read any of the Harry Potter books, I suggest you do as they are really good. Ok, the first two are somewhat short and could probably be skipped. They are short enough though that you might as well read them, as the background from them will make the rest of the books more enjoyable. 

As for the rest of the books. Each one is better than the one before it. Read them!
