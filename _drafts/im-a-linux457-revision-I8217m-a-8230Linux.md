It seems that Novell has been working on some &#8220;I&#8217;m a Linux&#8221; ads to go up against the whole &#8220;I&#8217;m a PC&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;m a mac&#8221; ads.

They don&#8217;t look too bad

  


The [Linux foundation has announced a competition](http://video.linuxfoundation.org/category/video-category/-linux-foundation-video-contest) to do some as well, not sure what they have come up with yet.

There are loads of other bad ones floating around youtube too.
