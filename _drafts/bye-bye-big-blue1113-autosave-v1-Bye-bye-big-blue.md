  After nearly 10 years with IBM, I am moving on&#8230; Today is my last day with IBM.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  I suppose my career with IBM really started as a pre-university placement at IBM, which makes my time in IBM closer to 11 years.  I worked with some of the WebSphere technical sales and pre-sales teams in Basingstoke, doing desktop support and Lotus Domino administration and application design, though I don&#8217;t like to remind people that I hold a qualifications on Domino :p
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  I then joined as a graduate in 2005, and spent most of my time working on Integration Bus (aka Message Broker, and several more names) and enjoyed working with some great people over the years. The last 8 months or so have been with the QRadar team in Belfast, and I really enjoyed my time working with such a great team.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  I have done test roles, development roles, performance work, some time in level 3 support, and enjoyed all of it. Even the late nights the day before release were usually good fun (the huge pizzas helped!).
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  I got very involved with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=as4Da-iU5ec">IBM Hursley&#8217;s Blue Fusion</a> events, which were incredible fun and a rather unique opportunity to interact with secondary school children.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Creating an Ubuntu-based linux desktop for IBM, with over 6500 installs, has been very rewarding and something I will remember fondly.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  I&#8217;ve enjoyed my time in IBM and made some great friends. Thanks to everyone that helped make my time so much fun.
