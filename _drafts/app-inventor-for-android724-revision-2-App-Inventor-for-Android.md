Saw this recently on the Google blog:

> App Inventor is a new tool in Google Labs that makes it easy for anyone—programmers and non-programmers, professionals and students—to create mobile applications for Android-powered devices. And today, we’re extending invitations to the general public.

It looks really cool, and allows really quick generation of apps via a gui interface which is powered by [MIT&#8217;s Open Blocks](http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/41550) framework which sounds like a really cool way to get children and students into programming

I can&#8217;t wait to get my invite to try it out!
