8pm Tuesday night, and I am watching some trash on TV (or maybe it was a dvd &#8211; I don&#8217;t remember). There is a knock at the door, and I open it to find an ID card for the TV Licensing company&#8230;

I recently moved house, and tried to change address with them via their automated phone system. In fact I tried again for each red letter I received warning me that I didn&#8217;t have a TV license (two I think).

Anyway, the guy turned up saying &#8220;we have the technology&#8221;, obviously referring to the idea that they can &#8220;detect what tv you are watching from outside your house&#8221;. I never got how that works, especially with a LCD tv. Given that they have to be invited onto your property to see what is on your tv, and are trespassing if they don&#8217;t, then I am not sure how they can actually fine you if you say you don&#8217;t receive TV.

Of course the real joke is that I do have a license, and it is paid via Direct Debit. The problem is that they do not have the technology to change the address on that license as I have tried several times. The guy said he would do it when he got back to his hotel (the gprs connection on his handheld device apparently wouldn&#8217;t let him do it then and there), but I honestly expect to get another threatening letter.

How much money would they save if their automated phone change-of-address system actually worked? Surely it must be cheaper than sending a guy out all over the country, only to have him get shown a load of valid licenses that have the wrong address still&#8230;
