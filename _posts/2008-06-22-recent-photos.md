I thought it&#8217;s about time I mentioned the photos I have been taking recently

Some are random (as seen below)

[<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3180/2601165596_b295faf28f.jpg" border="0" alt="img_14884" width="333" height="500" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/antonpiatek/2601165596/){.tt-flickr.tt-flickr-Medium}

I also snapped a close-up of some ants and other insects (aphids?)) eating at the stem of my sunflower. I was quite surprised at the detail I got, though admittedly it was with my ef-s 60mm macro lens

I also got a nice shot of a bee while on a walk one lunchtime at work

And then there is my whole set of photos from Hinton Ampner, which I realised I didn&#8217;t have the old ones from last year up, so theres a fair few in there including a whole pile trying to catch a bee flying. (click on the photo below to see the whole set)

And I recently took photos of the Hursley Model Railway (again click on the image below to see the whole set). Some of these were done with an off-camera flash with a coloured gel, which produced some interesting effects, though not very life-like.
