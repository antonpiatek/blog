I went for a walk about a week ago around Southampton common just before sunset. I didnt want to take a big camera, as the point was to go for a walk and then on to the pub on the common, so I brought my compact DMC-FX33 with me.

It turns out that the camera is pretty good with sunset shots, getting rather nice exposures which surprised me for a camera that is so small and has little manual control. I think I need to start taking it with me to more places and try it out a bit more. The only thing it lacks is some serious zoom, but the 28mm (equiv) wide end is very nice for landscapes
