My DeveloperWorks article on [Monitoring message flow performance with the WebSphere Message Broker Explorer Accounting and Statistics facility](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/0710_piatek/0710_piatek.html) has finally been published!

_The new WebSphere Message Broker Accounting and Statistics facility can help you monitor message flow performance and resource usage of a broker or execution group at the message flow, node, or terminal level, and can thus be a tremendous help in solving performance and resource utilization problems._  
Hopefully you will find it a good starting guide for working with the new Accounting and Statistics views in IS02
