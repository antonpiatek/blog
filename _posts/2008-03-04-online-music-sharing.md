tech,blorge.com haveÂ  an [article](http://tech.blorge.com/Structure:%20/2008/03/03/reznor-releases-new-nin-album-via-online-experiment/) on Trent Reznor releaseing his new NIN album free online. Following RadioHead&#8217;s success with their online alblum, you can download the first 9 tracks for free, and have the rest as mp3&#8217;s for $5 &#8211; I have just downloaded the free tracks, if I like them then $5 is very cheap for 36 songs. I will probably buy the $10 CD version, as $5 would make me feel cheap. I wonder who else will follow the trend&#8230;
