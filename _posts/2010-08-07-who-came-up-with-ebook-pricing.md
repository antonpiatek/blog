Seriously&#8230; Who decided how to price eBooks?

A friend at work recently recommended I read Richard Morgan&#8217;s Altered Carbon. The Kindle app on android allowed me to find it quickly and download the first 3 chapters free to read &#8211; I loved it and decided I wanted to read the rest of it&#8230; However when checking the prices I was left the feeling that eBooks are just too expensive for what they are

[Play.com £5.99](http://www.play.com/Books/Books/4-/196726/Altered-Carbon/Product.html)  
[Amazon UK £5.19  
](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Altered-Carbon-Gollancz-Richard-Morgan/dp/0575081244/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1281176341&sr=8-1) <span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Orion-Publishing-Group-Altered-Carbon/dp/B002U3CBZM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=digital-text&qid=1281176341&sr=8-2">Kindle (Amazon UK) £4.88</a></span>

<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">I went with Play as their free delivery normally takes about 2 days, so that was great. But seriously, nearly the same price for Kindle? For a book I cannot resell, lend or give away?</span>

<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">Digital books should be much, much cheaper &#8211; There is no printing cost involved, so the book should be significantly cheaper, but this is not what I am seeing.</span>

<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">If I choose to keep the book and reread it again in a few years, the price may be fine. But I am more likely to read it once, and then give it to a friend to read. Why should i pay nearly the same price for something I cannot lend, sell, or give to a charity shop?</span>

<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">Also, how on earth does a paper book qualify for no VAT, yet as soon as that book has no paper involved I have to pay VAT?!?</span>

There are lots of Kindle books for £3 or less, and for these I will probably just buy it digitally as its incredibly cheap. But if I wanted to buy a recent release, then I really am paying a lot more for a digital book just to have it early? Why?  
I can understand pricing getting lower for older books as they have to compete with people lending books, libraries and second-hand sales, however none of that is possible for DRM protected eBooks, so they should all be priced the same as older releases
