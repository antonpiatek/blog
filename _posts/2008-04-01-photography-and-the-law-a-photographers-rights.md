Photojojo has an article on photographers rights:  [Photography and The Law: Know Your Rights](http://photojojo.com/content/tips/legal-rights-of-photographers/)

It looks like a good read. If you are in the UK like me, I strongly suggest you also read  <http://www.sirimo.co.uk/ukpr.php> which is UK specific.

Its probably worth mentioning that neither myself or the two links above are sound legal advice, and if you think you might have a problem with the law and your photos you should be talking to a qualified lawyer.
