An Australian, a Kiwi and South African are in a bar one night having a beer. All of a sudden the South African drinks his beer, throws his glass in the air, pulls out a gun and shoots the glass to pieces. 

&#8220;In Seth Efrika our glasses are so cheap that we don&#8217;t need to drink from the same one twice,&#8221; he says.

The Kiwi, obviously impressed by this, drinks his beer, throws his glass into the air, pulls out his gun and shoots the glass to pieces.&#8221;Wull mate, in Noo Zulland we have so much sand to make the glasses that we don&#8217;t need to drink out the same glass either,&#8221; he says.

The Australian, cool as a Koala, picks up his beer and drinks it, throws his glass in the air, pulls out his gun and shoots the South African and the  
Kiwi. 

He turns to the astonished barman and says, &#8220;In Strailya mate, we have so many bloody South Africans and Kiwis that we don&#8217;t need to drink with the  
same ones twice.&#8221;
