I have started doing some photography for other people, so decided I should really put some effort into how I present the photos. I thought about buying an inkjet for printing labels, but they weren&#8217;t all that cheap and from my experience with inkets in the past the ink dries out and is rather expensive to replace.

I also had problems finding inkets that could print direct to cd from linux&#8230; Then BlueMonki suggested a LightScribe drive. LightScribe is a technology where you put the disk in the burner upside down and it etches a label onto it. Of course you need a new drive and specific media, but the drives are available for Â£20 and media is less than 30p each, which is more expensive than a normal dvd+r but not a problem for occasional use.

I picked up a Samsung drive because it was cheap, and came with 3 faceplates, so I could match my silver pc case. I was a little worried that I would have a hard time making the software work, but it was really easy.

Install the [LightScribe system software](http://www.lightscribe.com/downloadSection/linux/index.aspx?id=814), available in 32bit .debs, and install it with _sudo dpkg -i <downloaded deb>_  
Then install the [LaCie LightScribe labeller](http://www.lacie.com/support/support_manifest.htm?id=10204) software which you will have to convert with _alien &#8211;scripts <downloaded file.rpm>_ before you can install it (you might need to install alien from apt/synaptic first), then install it with dpkg as well

You can also use the LightScribe simple labeller if you just want text, but its a little boring to do that.

You will probably want to work on your images with Gimp, or your favourite image tool, to add text to your cd label, though you could just use an image without text.

I found a cd template file [here](http://fox-gieg.com/tutorials/2006/lightscribe-for-mac/), which I modified
