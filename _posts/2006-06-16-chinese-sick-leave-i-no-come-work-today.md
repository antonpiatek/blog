Hung Chow calls work and says, &#8220;Hey, boss I no come work today, I really sick. I got headache, stomach ache and my legs hurt, I no come work.&#8221;

The boss says, &#8220;You know Hung Chow, I really need you today. When I feel like that I go to my wife & tell her give me sex. That makes everything better and I go work. You try that.&#8221;

Two hours later Hung Chow calls again. &#8220;Boss, I do what you say and I feel great. I be at work soon. You got nice house!
