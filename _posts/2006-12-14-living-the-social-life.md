The last few days have seen two socials at work for me. First I had a Christmas pub lunch with the test department as I spent the first six months of the year there, and then yesterday we had a thank-you trip to London for the whole department. The thank-you was of course for the realease of the latest version of the product, which was almost a year ago and well overdue.  
Yesterday was the most interesting, as we went to see [The Producers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Producers_(musical)) in the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Despite having lived in London for three years during my degree, and a year after I never got round to seeing a West End musical.  
I thoroughly enjoyed the show &#8211; the cast were incredibly talented, and the whole thing incredibly well produced. I would recommend it to anyone, though it stops running soon.  
Then we went for dinner in [Simpson&#8217;s-in-the-Strand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpsons-in-the-Strand), part of the Savoy. The food there was incredible. I have to say that it was the best steak I have ever had! The service however was not what I expected from the Savoy. I was wondering if perhaps I should have had a tie on, but in retrospect it was certainly not necessary. Maybe the main restaurant is better, but the private function room we had simply lacked the quality of service I was expecting. I won&#8217;t bash them too much, but suffice to say I have had better service in cheaper places.
