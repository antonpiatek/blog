I was reading on a friends blog a while ago about air miles (I have forgotten who now), and wondered how many air miles I did last year&#8230;

According to [kls2.com](http://gc.kls2.com/cgi-bin/gc?PATH=LHR-BKK-SYD-MYA%2CMYA-SYD-MEL%2CMEL-HKG-LHR%0D%0ASOU-BHD%2CBHD-SOU%2CSOU-BHD%2CBHD-SOU%0D%0A&RANGE=&PATH-COLOR=red&PATH-UNITS=mi&PATH-MINIMUM=&SPEED-GROUND=&SPEED-UNITS=kts&RANGE-STYLE=outline&RANGE-COLOR=navy&MAP-STYLE=) my flights last year totaled 23,000 air miles. Quite scary really, especially as I feel I didnt really fly much.

The one trip to Australia clocks up over 21,000 miles on its own.
