If you use a Linux or Unix box with bash or zsh, and you haven&#8217;t come across [Liquid Prompt](https://github.com/nojhan/liquidprompt), then I suggest you head there right now to install it. I&#8217;m loving having more info on the status line, especially near code version control, but even having cpu load and temperature along with battery life right under where I am typing is really useful
