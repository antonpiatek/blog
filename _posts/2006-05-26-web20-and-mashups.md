After a talk at work on the web2.0, I had a look at a couple of the mashups that were talked about. [Real Time Satellite Tracking](http://www.n2yo.com/) and [WeatherBonk](http://www.weatherbonk.com/weather/index.jsp?query=uk&showWB=true&showDir=true&showCams=true&webCamCategory=All&alertCategory=&showBarbs=on#) were both really quite cool. I am sure there are plenty more, but I thought I&#8217;d share these 2 with you.

(and thanks to [Roo](http://eightbar.co.uk/about/roo/) for the awesome presentation!)
