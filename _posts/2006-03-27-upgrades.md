So I updates [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/), [Gallery](http://gallery.menalto.com/) and the [plugin](http://wpg2.ozgreg.com/index.php/Main_Page) that joins the two, hoping that nothing would break&#8230;

Well, all hell broke loose.

First of all, gallery decided not to let me in with my admin login nor reset any passwords, so by logging in with a test I account and hacking that account with mysql to make it an admin I finally captured control of my gallery. I then re-edited all details for the admin account  
So having got galler upgraded, then wordpress upgraded, and finally the wp-g2 plugin, I was left with my theme looking a bit wrong, as all the gallery specific stuff needs re-writing&#8230;

I plan to sort that all out soon, but will have to wait untl I have some more time.
