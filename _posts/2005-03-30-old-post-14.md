Mrs. Davidson&#8217;s dishwasher quit working so she calls a repairman. Since she has to go to work the next day, she tells him, &#8220;I&#8217;ll leave the key under the mat. Fix the dishwasher, leave the bill on the counter, and I&#8217;ll mail you the check. Oh, by the way, don&#8217;t worry about my bulldog, Spike, he won&#8217;t bother you. But, whatever you do, do NOT, under ANY circumstances, talk to my parrot!&#8221;

When the repair man arrives at Mrs Davidson&#8217;s apartment the next day, he discovers the biggest and meanest Bull Dog he has ever seen. But just as she said, the dog just lay there on the carpet watching the repairman go about his business. The Parrot, however, drove him nuts the whole time with his incessant yelling, cursing, and name calling. Finally the repairman couldn&#8217;t contain himself any longer and yelled, &#8220;Shut up, you stupid ugly f\***ing bird!&#8221;

To which the parrot replied, &#8220;Get him, Spike!&#8221;
