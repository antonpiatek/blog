I noticed the stickers that are up on [eightbar » Blog Archive » Sometimes We’re So American](http://eightbar.co.uk/2006/08/02/sometimes-were-so-american/) a week or so ago. I have no idea when they arrived, but they did strike me as being very, very American. It felt very odd.

Unfortunately I have not had a camera with me (and my phone camera isn&#8217;t going to do much good for anything), so you&#8217;ll have to pop over to eightbar for the photo.
