If I have ever seen a case of too much time on your hands, this would be it: [Quake Done Quick](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7423603596413693402&q=Quake+quick) and [Quake II Done Quick](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8177060207477689613) [Google Video]

They are actually very, very impressive but I cannot help but wonder if they were actually done by a person, or if they were scripted as the rocket and grenade jumps are so perfectly timed.
