&#8220;After a brief rummage, I noticed that if instead of doing what they tell you to do, you go to https://autoreg.autoregister.net/ you get prompted for whether you&#8217;re signing up for Broadband or Dialup, and on clicking Broadband, you&#8217;re lead through the sign-up procedure with no complaints about compatibility, and within 5 minutes he was online with his GNU/Linux (Ubuntu) system and Firefox browser.&#8221;
