I recently had the opportinity to review the new Panasonic Lumix G1 Digital SLR.[<img class="alignnone" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3293/3005469017_abaab16e65.jpg" alt="img_18243" width="500" height="333" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/antonpiatek/3005469017/ "img_18243"){.tt-flickr.tt-flickr-Medium} [<img class="alignright" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3278/3005470453_599ea07fc3_m.jpg" alt="img_18246" width="240" height="160" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/antonpiatek/3005470453/ "img_18246"){.tt-flickr.tt-flickr-Small} [<img class="alignleft" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3062/3006304942_f03b352af7_m.jpg" alt="img_18245" width="240" height="160" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/antonpiatek/3006304942/ "img_18245"){.tt-flickr.tt-flickr-Small} [<img class="alignright" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3155/3006304498_3df8879eb2_m.jpg" alt="img_18244" width="240" height="160" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/antonpiatek/3006304498/ "img_18244"){.tt-flickr.tt-flickr-Small}

The first thing to say about this camera, is that it blurs the term SLR. Strictly speaking, SLR means [Single Lens Reflex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-lens_reflex_camera) &#8211; in laymans terms this means what you see in the viewfinder is a what the camera will take, which is achieved through the use of mirrors and prisms. The G1 uses no mirrors or prisms, as it is fully digital so the viewfinder is digital. This is exactly what a compact digital camera uses for the screen on the back, often referred to as &#8220;live mode&#8221; on SLR models.  
Without mirrors you might say it is not an SLR, however you still see what is coming through the lens and it shows what will be recorded when you hit the shutter button.
