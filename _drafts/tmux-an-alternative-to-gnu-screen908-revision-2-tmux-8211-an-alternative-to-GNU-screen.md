tmux is an alternative to gnu screen. While I like screen, it annoys me that you can&#8217;t easily split the window and rearrange panes in it. tmux allows this quite easily, and there is a shortcut key to toggle through various layouts which makes it quite powerful to work with. One thing I have been trying to get going for a while is a script which starts a tmux session with multiple split panes, each with an application running in them so that I can start up several things at once and have them all available to watch on the same screen.

The one annoyance I have with tmux is that it appears there is no way to take a window and pull it into a pane. This can be rather annoying, so I tend to try and only use new panes in my session rather than multiple windows (only one window can be viewed at a time, though each window can have multiple panes)

I had problems setting the tmux option to stop windows and panes closing after the program exits (If my program exits, I want to see the error it wrote, and probably restart it). So instead I wrote a script to split the window into panes as desired and then send the commands to each pane to start the program I wanted running in it.

The following is my script for starting tmux, hopefully it is useful to others.

> #!/bin/bash  
> SESSION=house
> 
> #Connect to existing session if it exists  
> if [[ $(tmux attach -t $SESSION) ]]  
> then  
> Â  exit;  
> fi
> 
> #Otherwise start new session  
> tmux new-session -d -s $SESSION
> 
> #First command  
> tmux send-keys &#8216;~/bin/read_power.sh&#8217; C-m \;
> 
> #Horizontal split and second command  
> tmux split-window -h -t $SESSION  
> tmux send-keys &#8216;~/arduino/FC/FC.py&#8217; C-m \;
> 
> #vertical split and third command (in bottom right pane)  
> tmux split-window -t $SESSION  
> tmux send-keys &#8216;~/bin/lcd-controller.py&#8217; C-m \;
> 
> #Select left pane, split vertical and fourth command in bottom left  
> tmux select-pane -L  
> tmux split-window -t $SESSION  
> tmux send-keys &#8216;net-mqtt-sub \#&#8217; C-m \;
> 
> #Attach to new session  
> tmux attach -t $SESSION
