A while ago I wrote a post on [Spore](http://strangeparty.com/2006/03/20/spore/), now the BBC have [posted](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/click_online/4997036.stm) on it. There is a link to a video interview with the creator of spore at the top of the page, but I will have to wait until I get home to watch it and see if it is the same as the one I have in my post.
