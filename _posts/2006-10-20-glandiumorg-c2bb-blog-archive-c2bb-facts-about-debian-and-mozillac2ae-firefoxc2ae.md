Following from my [previous post about Mozilla Firefox and Debian](http://www.strangeparty.com/2006/10/12/mozilla-vs-debian-analyzed/), there has been a very thorough and good blog post about the whole thing. [Facts about Debian and Mozilla® Firefox®](http://web.glandium.org/blog/?p=97) explains the whole problem very clearly.

Definetely worth a read!
