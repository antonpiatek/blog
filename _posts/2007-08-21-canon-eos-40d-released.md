[Canon EOS 40D, previewed: Digital Photography Review](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0708/07082010canoneos40d.asp)

I have been holding off buying a new camera to see what this one would be like. I have to say, it looks worth the extra money.

The large sensor and self cleaning are one thing, but the live shooting mode (shoot through screen like a compact digital camera) looks incredible&#8230; I will be spending a while hunting for the best price on this camera.
