So, some of you may have heard of the campaign for getting Rage Against the Machine to no1 in the UK charts for Christmas.

If you want to take part, have a look at the [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2228594104) page for where you can buy a digital download of the track &#8220;Killing In The Name Of&#8221;

Now, part of me thinks this is great, lets get a real band to christmas number one (I don&#8217;t think I can remember what the last \*real\* band to do so was once you ignore all the Xfactor winners, tellytubbies and bob-the-builders). Another part of me thinks that perhaps this is just a publicity stunt for Rage Against the Machine. It is a real shame the band did not decide to give all money they got this week to charity!

Another part of me wonders if this is a bit of a social experiment, to see if the internet is more popular and influential than Simon Cowell and XFactor&#8230;
