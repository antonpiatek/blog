I am moving my photos into Flickr (at quite a slow pace to be honest) and as I pay per GB for my hosting here, I figured I could finally remove my photos from this site and just link to the ones on flickr&#8230; however this is not as easy as it sounds as I have quite a few of them linked into posts here. There is no easy way to migrate these, you can&#8217;t automate it because flickr doesn&#8217;t seem to track the original filename of photos, and doing it by hand is tedious to say the least.

I am not sure if it is worth the effort, and maybe I should just put a comment in each of the posts with photos to say thay are on flickr and youll have to find them yourself?

Hopefully flickr will be the last time I have to move photos &#8211; even if I decide on something better to hots my photos on, there is no need to delete them from flickr
