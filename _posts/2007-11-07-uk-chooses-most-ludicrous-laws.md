[BBC NEWS | UK chooses &#8216;most ludicrous laws&#8217;](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7081038.stm)

There are some ridiculous laws which are still on the books, including:

It is illegal to die in the Houses of Parliament

Eating mince pies on Christmas Day is banned

In the UK a pregnant woman can legally relieve herself anywhere she wants, including in a policeman&#8217;s helmet

It is illegal not to tell the tax man anything you do not want him to know, but legal not to tell him information you do not mind him knowing

It is legal to murder a Scotsman within the ancient city walls of York, but only if he is carrying a bow and arrow

**Update (17:50)** &#8211; It seems the BBC has edited the page as some laws were not able to be verified. So much for research for a story&#8230;
