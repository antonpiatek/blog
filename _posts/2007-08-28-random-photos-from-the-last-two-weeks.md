I found a nice spders web in the garden, so had a go at trying to capture him in the web &#8211; unfortunately he was facing the other way, so I have a photo of his underside.

The macro lens did work well for it though

I also found an interesting strawberry in a punnett from the supermarkey, it had a flower on it. So two speedlight flashes and I tried a close-up shot

And we have been playing a lot of scrabble since the awfully wet weekend we had, which complelled us to go out for the purpose of buying scrabble. I was playing with the aperture to reduce the depth of field.
