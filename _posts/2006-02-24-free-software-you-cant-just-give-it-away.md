[The Times Online](http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,9075-2051196,00.html) has a wonderful article about a UK Trading Standards officer who couldn&#8217;t believe that Mozilla (being free software) is allowed to be sold for profit by someone. This article is well worth a read, so READ IT!
