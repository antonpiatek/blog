Inspired by [The Lost Outpost](http://andypiper.wordpress.com/) I have moved my site theme to feedburner as I keep seeing links that I want to post but not write a full blog about. Feedburner allows you to splice in your del.icio.us links in every day. Now all I have to do is bookmark the interesting links in del.icio.us. I suppose I should also figure out some way of showing the latest links on the site too&#8230;

Edit: The new feeds are <http://feeds.feedburner.com/Strangeparty> and <http://feeds.feedburner.com/CommentsForStrangeparty>
