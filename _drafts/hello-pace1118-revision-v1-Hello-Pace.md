After [leaving IBM](http://www.strangeparty.com/2015/06/04/bye-bye-big-blue/) I&#8217;ve joined [Pace](http://www.pace.com/) at their [Belfast office](http://www.pace.com/global/careers/vacancy-locations-index/belfast/). It is quite a change of IT sectors, though still the same sort of job. Software development seems to have a lot in common no matter which industry it is for.

There&#8217;s going to be some interesting learning, things like DVB are pretty much completely new to me, but at the same time it&#8217;s lots of Java and C++ with similar technology stacks involved. Sadly less perl, but more Python so maybe I&#8217;ll learn that properly. I&#8217;m likely to work with some more interesting Javascript frameworks, in particular Angular.js which should be fun.

The job is still Software Development, and there should be some fun challenges with things like allowing a TV set top box to do on demand video content when all you have is a one-way data stream from a satellite, for instance, which make for some interesting solutions. I&#8217;m working in the [Cobalt team](http://www.pace.com/global/our-portfolio/elements/cobalt-service-delivery/) which deals with a delivering data from the TV provider onto set top boxes, so things like settings, software updates, programme guides and on demand content and even apps. Other teams in the office work with the actual video content encryption and playback and the UI the set top box shows.

The local office seems to be all running Fedora, so I&#8217;m saying goodbye to Ubuntu at work. I already miss it, but hopefully will find Fedora enjoyable in the long term.

The office is on the other side of Belfast so is a marginally longer commute, but it&#8217;s still reasonable to get to. [Stranmillis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranmillis) seems a nice area of Belfast, and it&#8217;s a 10 minute walk to the Botanical gardens so I intend to make some time to see it over lunch, which will be nice as I really miss getting out as I could in Hursley and its surrounding fields.
