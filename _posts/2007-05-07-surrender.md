Saturday was spent paintballing with 7 friends from work down at [Delta Force](http://www.paintballgames.co.uk/index.htm), Romsey. I have been paintballing several times, but not in the last few years. The center was very nice, and well run. The game areas were fabulous, though much smaller than [Skirmish](http://www.skirmishlasham.com/), Lasham where I have mostly played.

The games included a wonderful bridge game (3 bridges and no other way across) first thing in the morning, which Pete and I stormed across, flanking the other team and completely destroying them. Another game had the purpose of gaining control of 5 huts, in which we excelled as well &#8211; not to mention being fantastic fun. After that, the marshalls were looking to move some people from the winning team to the losing one, as the teams were hardly balanced. I persuaded them to move the four of us that had been split up back into one big group on the losing team, and that balanced out the teams a bit. We ended up losing the day but we were there for the fun, not the certificates.

The day was not paricularly cheap, and comparing to Skirmish&#8217;s website, they might have been cheaper (though much further away). The lunch was dissappointing, so bring your own &#8211; Skirmish once had a whole hog roast for lunch, but then they seem to have a huge number more people as well as much bigger game areas to play in.

Overall though, it was a fantastic day out and only left me with one nasty looking bruise and a few sore spots.
