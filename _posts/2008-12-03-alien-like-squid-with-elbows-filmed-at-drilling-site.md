[Alien-like Squid With &#8220;Elbows&#8221; Filmed at Drilling Site](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/11/081124-giant-squid-magnapinna.html)

> A mile and a half two and a half kilometers underwater, a remote control submersible&#8217;s camera has captured an eerie surprise: an alien-like, long-armed, and—strangest of all—&#8221;elbowed&#8221; Magnapinna squid

It is certainly interesting that this sort of video is now coming from commercial oil research and not scientific research&#8230;
