I just upgraded this blog to the latest wordpress (2.5), and found that my flickr posting plugin had broken. I had a look at the code, but despite being pretty quick to figure out what needed changing, a new version of the plugin has been released which supports wordpress 2.5

If you use wordpress, and want to post flickr images, I strongly recommend [Flickr Photo Album for WordPress.](http://tantannoodles.com/toolkit/photo-album/) I also strongly recommend upgrading to wordpress 2.5, the admin interface is rewritten, and seems to work much better[
