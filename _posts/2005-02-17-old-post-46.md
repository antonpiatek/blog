[Napster&#8217;s DRM has been circumvented](http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3189925a28,00.html). 

Not really all that surprising. They just use a winamp plugin that lets you record to wav!

The Naptser company seems to not be concerned with this, as they knew people could do it. But what will the RIAA think? Online distribution will be the future of music sales, so they had better think carefully before suing anyone. 

Isn&#8217;t it about time that music distribution companies started letting people play their music anywhere? Why the hell would you pay a subscription to Napster, if you can&#8217;t play your new music in your car on your way to work, or night out?

It doesn&#8217;t make any sense to me, why they bother with the DRM. Everyone knows that it will be crakced pretty quickly&#8230;
