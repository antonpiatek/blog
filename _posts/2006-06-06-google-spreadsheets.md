Well, i suppose it was only a matter of time before they did it. [Google Spreadsheets &#8211; Sneak Peek](http://www.google.com/googlespreadsheets/tour1.html)

I am looking forward to the day when I can grab my files from any computer and edit them on any computer (windows/mac/linux) and not have to have a particular version of software installed. Of course I would rather not have Google store all my documents, but so long as I can access them from somewhere I consider secure then I am happy.
