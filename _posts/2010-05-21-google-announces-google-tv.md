I am surprised it has taken someone so long to try and merge the web and tv&#8217;s successfully (ignoring hobby projects like [MythTv](http://www.mythtv.org/)). I am slightly suprised it was Google, but given they own [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/) maybe I shouldn&#8217;t have been so surprised
