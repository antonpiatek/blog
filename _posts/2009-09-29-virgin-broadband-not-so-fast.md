I wrote a while ago about the speed of [virgin broadband vs. Be](http://www.strangeparty.com/2009/07/09/broadband-speed-comparison-be-vs-virgin/) but my internet has been feeling rather slow recently&#8230; So I decided to take another speed test.

<img class="alignnone" title="Virgin speedtest" src="http://www.speedtest.net/result/578142295.png" alt="" width="300" height="135" /> 

For reference the previous test got 9Mb/s download and 0.49Mb/s upload. The old speed wasn&#8217;t too bad, but still wasn&#8217;t as good as Be provided.

Obviously this new one is slower &#8211; the question is why? this test was about the same time of day, and as luck would have it the same day of the week. Is July a quieter internet usage month that September? Or has my service just become over-subscribed?

I will certainly be thinking carefully when it comes to the end of my contract&#8230; as paying for 10mbit and getting 2.4 is hardly value for money&#8230;
