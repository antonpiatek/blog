I was born in Australia but grew up there, Cyprus, Italy and the UK. I now live near BelfastÂ and work for IBM Security. I love my photography as you can probably tell by the number of photos.

I am also available for hire as a photographer &#8211; see my website at <http://antonpiatek.co.uk/>  
I mostly shoot Weddings and Music gigs, however I will shoot just about anything if it sounds like fun!
