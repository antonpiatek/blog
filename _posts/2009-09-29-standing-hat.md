We bough a book on [Hampshire and New Forest walks](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0711706093) about a year ago, and finally actually did one of the walks in the New Forest. We did a really nice walk from [Standing Hat](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=50.831104,-1.55483&num=1&sll=54.136696,-4.042969&sspn=20.119194,53.569336&hl=en&ie=UTF8&ll=50.831475,-1.553965&spn=0.021088,0.052314&z=15), Balmerlawn near Brokenhurst.

The walk was a 8km walk, and the book suggested 2.5 hours but we spent 2 hours walking (which left time for a very nice lunch in a grassy clearing in the woods)

There are a lot of [cycle trails](http://www.new-forest-national-park.com/new-forest-cycling.html) in this part of the new forest, so we are planning on cycling there when we figure out a good way of getting bikes there (bike racks are not that cheap)
