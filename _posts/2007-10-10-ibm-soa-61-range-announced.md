I had meant all along to blog a little about work, so to reiterate a post from [SOA Tips ‘n’ Tricks](http://soatipsntricks.wordpress.com/2007/10/09/websphere-soa-61-products-announced/), the Websphere SOA 6.1 range has been announced by IBM: Websphere Message Broker, WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus, WebSphere Process Server, WebSphere Message Broker, the WebSphere Service Registry and Repository.
