Amazon UK recently launched their [online music store](http://www.amazon.co.uk/MP3-Music-Download/b/ref=topnav_storetab_dmusic?ie=UTF8&node=77197031), which seemed top open much quieter than I would have expected. It did make national radio (Radio 1) on my way home from work, however they were more interested in the fact that albums are £3 each (I think this is  promotional price) than the fact it is DRM free.

My biggest problem with iTunes (apart from the fact the iTunes software doesn&#8217;t run on linux) is that the files are DRM protected. This means I cannot play them on linux, and cannot play them on any portable player other than my iPod. Amazon&#8217;s music is mp3, DRM-free and will play on nearly all devices, all operating systems and I can even burn a mp3 (or normal audio cd) of songs to play elsewhere.

I seem to remember Apple trying to go DRM-free but the music companies objected (mind you, the music companies also wanted Apple to increase prices) but that doesn&#8217;t seem to have affected Amazon.

The radio news I was listening to suggested a price war resulting from this, however I am more interested in getting music I can actually play how and where I want.

As a side story, a friend recently had to get a new computer as their old one died. They got the music they had (windows WMA files, which were DRM protected) from the old disk, but had a hard time playing it. The new computer wasn&#8217;t allowed to play it! It took a lot of effort to get it working.

This is my biggest objection to DRM &#8211; It actually make things worse for the consumer, including making it harder to play and harder to backup.
