If you have $100,000 spare and like zoom lenses, you may want to think about this one:

> > If you&#8217;re into bird watching, the holy grail would have to be the Ivory-Billed Woodpecker, a huge (20&#8243; tall with a 30&#8243; wingspan), yet incredibly elusive woodpecker that despite reports of extinction, is spotted every now-and-then deep in the boonies of Florida and Arkansas. It&#8217;s also known as the &#8216;Lord G-d&#8217; woodpecker because that&#8217;s what spotters have been known to blurt out &#8211; often accompanied by soiled trousers &#8211; when dive-bombed by one. &#8216;Lord G-d&#8217; has also been exclaimed &#8211; minus the soiled trousers &#8211; by those seeing a Canon 1200/5.6L USM for the first time. At 36lbs, 33&#8243; long and 9&#8243; wide at the front element, calling this lens a &#8216;tele&#8217; is like calling King Kong a monkey.
