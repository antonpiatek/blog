[Security Fix has an interesting article](http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/03/they_told_you_not_to_reply.html) on the owner of the domain donotreply.com

>   _When businesses want to communicate with their customers via e-mail, many send messages with a bogus return address, e.g. &#8220;somethinghere@donotreply.com.&#8221; The practice is meant to communicate to recipients that any replies will go unread.But when those messages are sent to an inactive e-mail address or the recipient ignores the instruction and replies anyway, the missives don&#8217;t just disappear into the digital ether._
