So, on my revision break i am reading the [bbc news](http://news.bbc.co.uk) site, and what do I find:

Bill gates is the [most spammed person in the world](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4023667.stm), receiving up to 4 million spam emails a day.

[Alcohol is bad for breastfeeding](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4415903.stm), no brainer there.

In Florida [you can shoot an attacker in the street](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4415903.stm). The article says it might bring a wild west attitude&#8230; I think this is a rediculous idea, but if Dubya Bush&#8217;s brother signs it, it will be law. I&#8217;ll bet the number of door-to-door salesmen drops!

And some poor woman has received an [electricity bill for Â£38,000](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4414729.stm) for electricity she didnt use! Hmm, how wierd the world is.
