I have had spore nearly a week now, and have been totally hooked. The game is absolutely fabulous, and I am really enjoying it. My only complaint is that the first 4 sections (cell, creature/pack, tribe, civilisation) are shorter than I would have liked, though the final stage seems to have huge scopt.

One thing I did not realise is that the game only allows 3 installs per cd-key before locking it down. This seems quite extreme, and I am not the only one to think so &#8211; [BBC NEWS | Copyright row dogs Spore release](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7604405.stm)
