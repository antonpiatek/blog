I run a desktop machine under my TV. It is a media center for music, photos, and DVDs I have ripped for convenience. For a while it mostly ran MythTV with an idea to look at getting a TV tuner card for it (especially as my set-top DVR crashes more than I would like). This never really materialised.

The music playback used to be rather rubbish, but then a little while ago a colleague at work showed me MPD (Music Player Daemon). MPD simply is a music player backend. The frontend comes separately and I simply use mpdroid on my Android phone, and my wife uses similar software on her iPhone. This allows really easy browsing of songs and playback control, without needing to turn on the TV and without using any annoying remote controls. It also means I have music coming out of my nice sounds system, which is always good to have.

The box also does a few other things, such as the occasional bittorrent client for new linux releases, logging my power usage via a CurrentCost device. It is also my house filserver for music on both our desktops, but also (and most importantly) it is my backup copy of all my digital photos, for which I have RAID mirrored disks and weekly copies to make sure accidental deletions are minimised. So far my photos are logging 115GB of space, so it is not exactly a small requirement.  
(And for those that want to lecture about RAID not being a backup, there is the main copy on my desktop, and a copy on another machine at my parent&#8217;s house, so I think my files should be fairly safe)

I recently decided that the box probably uses too much power, so started hunting around for a replacement. I settled on an ASUS AT3IONT-I Deluxe motherboard, as it has a fanless dual-core CPU that should be good enough for HD playback, HDMI, optical audio and has enough SATA connectors to connect up to 4 drives. The board is a tiny mini-ITX system, and the deluxe version comes with an external 12V DC power adatpor. The system also has built-in wifi, and bluetooth, though I have yet to use them so far. It also comes with a quite cool remote control for a media PC, which I thought I would not use, but actually find amazing.
