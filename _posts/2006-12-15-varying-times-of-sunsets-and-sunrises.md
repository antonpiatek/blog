I have wondered for ages whether the times of sunset and sunrise are equally spaced around the solstice&#8217;s. It turns out [they are not](http://www.strudel.org.uk/blog/astro/000568.shtml). The author has also linked to a far more thorough explanation by [John Wholtz](http://members.aol.com/jwholtz/analemma/analemma.htm), which is a fascinating read[
