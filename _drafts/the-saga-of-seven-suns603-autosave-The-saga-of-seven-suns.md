It has been a little quiet here lately, the reason being is I have been completely consumed by reading [the saga of seven suns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saga_of_Seven_Suns) by Kevin J Anderson.

It is a seven book series of sci-fi, and I was completely addicted to it. I am not sure what I am going to do now that I have finished all seven (large) books, but it should leave me more time so long as I don&#8217;t have withdrawl symptoms from it&#8230;

If you enjoy science fiction books, I strongly recommend reading this series!
