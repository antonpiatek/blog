Trent Reznor told fans in Australia to &#8220;steal his CD&#8221; after he noticed the high prices of CD&#8217;s there. The video is on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ5iHaV0dP4&eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theninhotline.net%2Fnews%2Findex.php)

I remember The Offspring trying to give away their album online and their record label not liking it either (several years ago, I think it was the album Americana). Are we seeing a revolt by the musicians towards their labels?
