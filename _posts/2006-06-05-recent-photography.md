A week ago I went to the [Tower of London](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_london) and [took a few photos](http://strangeparty.com/wordpress/v/2006/Tower+of+London/)[  
](http://strangeparty.com/wordpress/v/2006/Tower+of+London/) 

<div class="g2image_normal">

</div>

I have also put up some photos of [Hursley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hursley_House) where I work. Unfortunately the house had scaffolding up, but the japanese garden was nice and the sundial was surprisingly accurate
