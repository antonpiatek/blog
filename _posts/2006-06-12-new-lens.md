The week before last I bought a 75-300mm lens for my camera on ebay. So last weekend I took it to [Battersea Park](http://www.batterseapark.org/) to try it out. I took a few too many photos. One or two of the photos are cropped, but they should be obvious. The rest are what I got with up to 300mm zoom.

The lens is wonderful, though with a polariser (which came free on it) you need plenty of sunlight to get a high enough shutter speed to hold it by hand. I would love a stabilising lens, but they are [expensive](http://jessops.co.uk/Store/s22119/0/Lenses/Canon/EF-70-200mm-f-and-40-L-USM-Lens/details.aspx?&IsSearch=y&pageindex=1&CatId=143&comp=y)
