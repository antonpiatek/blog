So, as there is a new version of WordPress (2.5.1) which has some serious security fixes, I thought I would move my blog to running from svn. This doesnt mean I am running bleeding edge code, it just means updating the WordPress code is as simple as _svn sw new\_version\_url_. Which is a lot simpler than downloading and unpacking tars over the top.
