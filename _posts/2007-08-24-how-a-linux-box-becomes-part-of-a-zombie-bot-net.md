Found via [Schneier](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/08/how_a_linux_ser.html), this article on [how a linux box became a zombie](http://blog.gnist.org/article.php?story=HollidayCracking) was a really interesting read. Both from an analysis of how the box was compromised, and some insight into the reality of trackind down the cracker. I think I could really enjoy a computer security job&#8230;
