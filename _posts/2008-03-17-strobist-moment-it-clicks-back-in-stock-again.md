Strobist is reporting that Joe McNally&#8217;s book &#8220;Moment it Clicks&#8221; is back in stock on Amazon. Along with this announcement, they have a fantastic video of Joe doing a photoshoot for National Geographic of the light at the top of the lightning mast of the Empire State Building. Check out the video on [Strobist.com](http://strobist.blogspot.com/2008/02/moment-it-clicks-back-in-stock-again.html)

When my copy of the book arrives, I will give you a review!
