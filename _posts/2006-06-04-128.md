George Bush is visiting the Queen and he asks her, &#8216;Your Majesty, how do you run such an efficient government? Are there any tips you can give me?&#8217;  
Well,&#8217; says the Queen, &#8216;the most important thing is to surround your self with intelligent people.&#8217;

Bush frowns, &#8216;But how do I know the people around me are really intelligent?&#8217; The Queen takes a sip of tea. Oh, that&#8217;s easy. You just ask them to answer an intelligence riddle. &#8216;The Queen pushes a button on her intercom. &#8216;Please send The Prime Minister in here, would you?&#8217;

Tony Blair walks into the room. &#8216;Your Majesty&#8230;'&#8221; The Queen smiles&#8221; Answer me this, please, Tony. Your mother and father have a child. It is not your brother and it is not your sister. Who is it?&#8217;  
&#8216;Without pausing for a moment, Blair answers, &#8216;That would be me!&#8217; &#8216;Yes! Very good!&#8217; says the Queen.

Back at the White House, Bush calls in his vice president, Dick Cheney. &#8216;Dick, answer this for me. Your mother and your father have a child. It&#8217;s not your brother and it&#8217;s not your sister. Who is it?&#8217;  
&#8216;I&#8217;m not sure,&#8217; says the vice president.&#8217;Let me get back to you on that one.&#8217;

Dick Cheney goes to his advisers and asks every one, but none can give him an answer.  
Finally, he ends up in the men&#8217;s room and recognises Colin Powell&#8217;s shoes in the next stall. Dick shouts, &#8216;Colin! Can you answer this for me? Your mother and father have a child and it&#8217;s not your brother or your sister. Who is it?&#8217; Colin Powell yells back,

&#8216;That&#8217;s easy. It&#8217;s me!&#8217; Dick Cheney smiles,  
&#8216;Thanks!&#8217; Cheney goes back to the Oval Office and asks to speak with Bush.

&#8216;Say, I did some research and I have the answer to that riddle. It&#8217;s Colin Powell.&#8217;

Bush gets up, stomps over to Dick Cheney, and angrily yells into his face, &#8216;No, you idiot! It&#8217;s Tony Blair!&#8217;
