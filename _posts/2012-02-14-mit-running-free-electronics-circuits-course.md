Thanks to Paul Stimpson on the Surrey LUG mailing list for pointing the course out:

> MIT are launching the first course in their new e-learning programme designed to bring education free to the masses. It&#8217;s a course in electronic circuits and design and begins on March 5th. This is a trial and at this stage does not require any attendance or for proof of identity to be shown. It is examined online and results in an MIT-branded certificate for successful students. The only obligations are to complete the course and exams in the time frame specified and to agree to the University honour code (not to cheat).
> 
> The course runs for 13 weeks (March 5th until June 8th) and requires a time investment of approximately 10 hours per week.
