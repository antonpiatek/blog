I needed a new CF card for my camera, and even though it is a 300D and doesnt seem to support the speed improvements I bought a 120x CF card thinking that when I upgrade my camera later this year then i could get the speed out of it (and not have to replace the card having only had it a few months).

I was quite surprised to find that the camera writes to disk twice as fast as with my old cards (42x and 48x speed). I was not expecting the card to make any difference with the 300D. Apparently it does&#8230;
