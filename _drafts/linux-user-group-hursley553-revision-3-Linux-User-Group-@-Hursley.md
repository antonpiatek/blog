On Saturday I hosted a group for 30 people at IBM Hursley for a [Hampshire Linux User Group](http://hants.lug.org.uk/) meeting.

We had a good set of talks, including [Andy Stanford-Clark](http://www.twitter.com/andysc) talking about his twittering house and mousetraps as well as the twittering [Red Funnel Ferries](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/6188760/Twittering-ferries-alert-passengers-to-delays.html) [telegraph.co.uk] and his energy monitoring via Current Cost devices.  
I did a brief (although rather technical) introduction to Debian packages (which will turn into a blogpost soon with any luck).  
Laura Cowen did a nice talk on [InfoSplicer](http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4042) which was originally designed for the Sugar platform of the [OLPC](http://laptop.org/) hardware.  
Tony Whitmore gave a rather interesting talk on podcasting, from his experience in doing the [Ubuntu UK Podcast](http://podcast.ubuntu-uk.org/)  
Adam Trickett talked about book reviews, and gave out a pile of free books for people to have in return for writing a review.

[Laura Cowen](http://lauracowen.co.uk/) also did an excellent writeup for [eightbar](http://eightbar.co.uk/2009/09/16/linux-users-descend-on-the-house/)

> On Saturday, we were mostly in the Auditorium (where Spitfires were built during WWII), then when we led everyone down to the Clubhouse for lunch, we took the usual site tour scenic route via the Sunken Garden and fish pond. Although Hursley is out in the country, seemingly the middle of nowhere, it’s actually on the bus-route from Winchester so we had an excellent turnout of about 30 people. IBM Hursley also has a lot of cool people who do cool things that we can tell people about (although one piece of feedback I heard from a LUG person was that they thought we didn’t talk enough about what IBM does!).

The day was terrific (at least for me) and I hope to organise another one in the near future, as it turned out to be nowhere near as hard as I thought it was going to be (I thought it was going to be difficult persuading security etc to let me bring 30 people on site over a weekend when the site only has minimal staff).
