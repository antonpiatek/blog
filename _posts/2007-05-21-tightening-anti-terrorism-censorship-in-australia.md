> &#8220;The proposed changes raise fundamental problems by infringing on the right to free speech,&#8221; says Stephen Blanks, secretary of the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties (NSWCCL).

A close friend ofmy parents is quoted in the article too!

> Alex Byrne, president of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA), argues that the changes amount to a censoring of ideas. &#8220;They&#8217;re censoring political views which they believe may incite terrorism. In doing that they&#8217;re censoring views that they see as inimical to good order. That is political censorship,&#8221; he says.Byrne says that the current classification code is adequate and has produced good results. &#8220;Expanding the ambit, to what are in fact political issues, fundamentally changes the (classification code) regime and it&#8217;s a very dangerous step for us to take,&#8221; he argues.
