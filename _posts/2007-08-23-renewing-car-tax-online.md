I just renewed my motorcycle tax online at <http://www.direct.gov.uk/taxdisc> and found it as simple as I did last year. I am still amazed at how many posts Andy gets on [his blog post on the subject](http://andypiper.wordpress.com/2006/03/25/renewing-car-tax-online/#comment-84729) from people who keep complaining about it being complex or asking advice. Especially as he is obviously not connected with the DVLA and the website for registering online is printed on the tax renewal form that is sent out!
