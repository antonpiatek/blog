Dale Lane has a very [informative post/review](http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=240) of [Jungle Disk](http://www.jungledisk.com/)

Jungle disk is an online backup/archive service powered by [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3) storage &#8211; Dale includes some calculated pricing from his usage, which is incredibly helpful. I think it might actually work out cheaper than buying the hard drives for my offsite backup server (let alone the cost of replacing dead hardware)

It really does look like a good way to backup all your RAW photos (flickr is not really a backup solution)
