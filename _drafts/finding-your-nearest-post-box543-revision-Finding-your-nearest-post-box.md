Having just moved house, I have loads of things to post (via snail mail). A large number of these are change of address details for way too many companies.

I couldn&#8217;t find anything on Royal Mail&#8217;s website, nor the Post Office&#8217;s, though there is a page to locate locate post office branches. Anyway, it turns out <http://www.dracos.co.uk/play/locating-postboxes/> has a rather good list of post boxes, and ties into google maps so you can easily see where they are &#8211; Fantastic!
