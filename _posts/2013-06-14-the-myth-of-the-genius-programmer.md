YouTube recently suggested this video to me, being several years old you may have seen it, but if you haven&#8217;t then I also recommend watching it. It is an interesting talk on the idea of a genius programmer, and will probably ring true for most programmers out there.



I found quite a few similarities in it with agile development techniques, and most of it applies to both open source projects and inside most commercial and corporate development teams. I really found a lot of the ideas and advice agreeing with agile ideas and generally sound like good ideas.
