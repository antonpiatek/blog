So having actually moved in to my new house at the beginning of the month, you would have thought I would be settled and have more time for blogging&#8230;  
You would be wrong &#8211; We decided we wanted some new carpets upstairs, and before we did that we thought it would be a good idea to paint the walls (that way we can&#8217;t ruin nice new carpets with paint). It turns out painting takes longer than you might think, especially when you have things like work getting in the way.
