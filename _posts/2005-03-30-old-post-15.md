At the end of the tax year the Tax Office sent an inspector to Audit the books of a synagogue. While he was checking the books he turned to the Rabbi and said, &#8220;I notice you buy a lot of candles. What do you do with the candle drippings?&#8221;

&#8220;Good question,&#8221; noted the Rabbi. &#8220;We save them up and send them back to the candle makers, and every now and then they send us a free box of candles.&#8221;

&#8220;Oh,&#8221; replied the auditor, somewhat disappointed that his unusual question had a practical answer. But on he went, in his obnoxious way:

&#8220;What about all these Matzo purchases? What do you do with the crumbs?&#8221;

&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; replied the Rabbi, realising that the inspector was trying to trap him with an unanswerable question. &#8220;We collect them and send them back to the manufacturers, and every now and then they send a free box of matzos.&#8221;

&#8220;I see,&#8221; replied the auditor, thinking hard about how he could fluster the know-it-all Rabbi.

&#8220;Well, Rabbi,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;what do you do with all the leftover foreskins from the circumcisions you perform?&#8221;

&#8220;Here, too, we do not waste,&#8221; answered the Rabbi. &#8220;What we do is save up all the foreskins and send them to the Tax Office, and about once a year they send us a complete dick like you.&#8221;
