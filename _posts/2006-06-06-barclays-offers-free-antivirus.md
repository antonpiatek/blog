I read about this in a computing magazine at work: Barclays is offering [free antivirus](http://www.personal.barclays.co.uk/BRC1/jsp/brccontrol?site=pfs&task=channelFWgroup&value=8722&target=_self) to its online banking customers. If you are a Barclays customer this may be useful to you, especially as it is fairly easy to sign up for online banking![
