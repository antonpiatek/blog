I have been debating buying either a netbook style computer or a tablet. In the end I decided on somethinng in between, and recently bought an Asus eee Transformer.

There are some bugs aroud the hardware keyboard. Browser performance is ot particularly brilliant with the keyoards as there is a fair delay. I also found that some keys dont quite wok properly. but that appeared to be related more wit the website and possibly javascript rather than the hardware keyboard itself (Specifically I had issues writing this post via the browser, however the wordpress android app is quite good and works incredibly well on a tablet). There are some blog post suggesting Asus has some fixes in the works, but it is not clear if they are already attempted or still to come.

Web browsing on the Transformer is very nice, as you would probably expect. Flash supports means it feels just like a real desktop browser experience. In fact, in some ways the browser experience is slightly nicer that on a PC, as pinch zoom and touchscreen scrolling feel very natural, even with a keyboard.  
The only negative about the browser experience, is that pages seem to load slightly slower than I have become accustomed to on my pc/laptop.

The gmail app is very nice, very well polished and uses the scren realestate quite well, as you woud expet from Google given that they wrote the OS!

Using the device for ssh is still a bit fiddly as the hardware keyboard is not supported by the current version of Connect Bot, though there is a fork which seems to sort out most of the problems. Alternatively, there is enough screen realestate to make the Hackers Keyboard a real alterntative, and as it has and escape key and all other keys, it is actually quite usable for remote sessions.
