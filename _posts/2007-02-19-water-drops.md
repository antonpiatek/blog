I have been rather busy lately, hence no posts for a while. Mostly busy with work, but also reading <a href="http://www.dunenovels.com/" target="_blank">Dune</a>, which is a fantastic book and has me completely addicted. I did get the chance last weekend to play with my camera.

Water drops are not the easiest things to take photos of, it requires fast shutter speeds and the focus is hard so a small aperture is needed. To get enough light I used a big flash and sheet of white paper behind the drops to reflect more light back. The hardest part though is getting the timing right. These are probably the best photos out of several hundred!
