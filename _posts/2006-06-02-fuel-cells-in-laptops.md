Finally it looks like the future is getting closer. The BBC have an article on [Fuel cells in laptops](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/5016984.stm) and it certainly looks interesting. Although we won&#8217;t see them until 2007, they do look pretty nifty&#8230;

A lot needs to happen by then, as at the moment they are too large and heavy, but given 100ml of ethanol will power your laptop for 10 hours, i think a lot of people would put up with the current problems without a problem.
