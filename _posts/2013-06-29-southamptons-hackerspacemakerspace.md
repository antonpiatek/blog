> _A hackerspace (also referred to as a hacklab, makerspace, or hackspace) is a community-operated workspace where people with common interests, often in computers, technology, science, digital art or electronic art, can meet, socialise and/or collaborate. [[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace)]_

SoMakeIt is Southampton&#8217;s makerspace has existed for nearly 4 months. It is [open Tuesdays 7:30 &#8211; 10:00pm and Saturdays 2:00 &#8211; 8:00pm](http://www.somakeit.org.uk/contact/) and is [located in Holybrook rd](http://www.somakeit.org.uk/contact/). We have a [website](http://www.somakeit.org.uk/) and [wiki](https://wiki.somakeit.org.uk/wiki/Main_Page) and are home to the longer-running group [Southackton](http://southackton.org.uk/).

We are run by our members, for our members, and are entirely funded by member donations. I should probably point out that [I am also a trustee of SoMakeIt.](http://www.somakeit.org.uk/trustees/)

We are building a [growing collection of tools (including a metalworking lathe!) and 3d printers](http://blog.somakeit.org.uk/2013/06/29/new-tools/), as well as some pretty good skills and knowledge, so come down and have a look at what we do!

Please spread the word and tell a friend about us too!
