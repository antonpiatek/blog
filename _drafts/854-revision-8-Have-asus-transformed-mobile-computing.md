I have been debating buying either a netbook style computer or a tablet. In the end I decided on somethinng in between, and recently bought an Asus eee Transformer.

There are some bugs aroud the hardware keyboard. Browser performance is ot particularly brilliant with the keyoards as there is a fair delay. I also found that some keys dont quite wok properly. but that appeared to be related more wit the website and possibly javascript rather than the hardwarekeyboard itself. There are some blog post suggesting Asus has some fixes in the works, but it is not clear if they are already attempted or still to comie.

Web browsing on he Transformer 

The gmail app is very nice, very well polished and uses the scren realestate quite well, as you woud expet from Google given that they wrote the OS!
