While a friend was staying with me a few days ago, we decided to get out the macro camera gear. We wandered around the house looking for something that took our fancy, and came across a couple of cacti I have. It turns out the spiky little things are quite interesting close-up. My EFs-60mm macro lens took all the photos below, except the last one which was taken with my friends lens and about 45mm of extension tubes

<span class="tt-flickr">Oddly enough, the cacti that looked the most interesting, were the ones with the larger spikes, and they looked better when slightly further out. The extension tubes allowed us to get closer than 1:1 (which is what my lens does), but that didnt make any of the photos more interesting.</span>
