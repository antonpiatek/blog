[UK&#8217;s newest sport | UK Ultimate](http://www.ukultimate.com/story/uks_newest_sport)

> UK Ultimate is delighted to announce that on 10th November 2008 confirmation was received that Ultimate has been officially “recognised” by UK Sport and the home country Sports Councils: Sport England, sportscotland, Sports Council Wales and Sport Northern Ireland.

The main reason I had heard before that it hadn&#8217;t been accepted is because the sport explicitly doesn&#8217;t have referees &#8211; the game is refereed by all the players together, acting in &#8220;the Spirit of the Game&#8221;

> Perhaps most of all it is worth stopping to consider that this milestone also means official acceptance of, and support for, self-refereeing and the Spirit of the Game.

It is interesting to see that the lack of referees didn&#8217;t actually stop it being accepted
